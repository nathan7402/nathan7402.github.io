I am a biotech professional, runner, mountaineer, and recreational photographer. This website is an attempt to capture all those dimensions in one place. It is currently *in progress*!

I envision this site containing a few different kinds of content:

1. blog posts on whatever interests me
2. personal reflections
3. trip reports
4. photos
5. the boring stuff (resume, bio, contact info, etc.)

I've made it mostly for myself, but if you find it interesting, please let me [know](nathan7402@gmail.com)!
